The "Python modular neural network toolbox" allows you to create different Neuron-Groups, define their Behavior and connect them with Synapse-Groups.

With this Simulator you can create all kinds of biological plausible networks, which, for example, mimic the learning mechanisms of cortical structures.

PymoNNto has many useful tools to speed up research and development, which are not limited to neural networks.
Examples for this are the Evolution package for parameter optimization or the Storage Manager for data access.
